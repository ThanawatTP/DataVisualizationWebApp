# COVID-19 Data Visualization in Thailand
Database Systems Project 

## Chart
This Chart uses Python's Altair library to generate various charts visualizing the total number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each province in Thailand.
The data used for this visualization is sourced from COVID-19 patients and deaths in Thailand. The dataset includes information on the number of cases and deaths in each province.

### Map Chart

The map chart visualizes the distribution of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Thailand. TopoJSON charts are used to display various information on a map. The map chart displays the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in each province using different colors and shades to indicate the severity of the situation in each region.

### Bar Chart

The bar chart represents the number of COVID-19 cases in each province in Thailand. The data used in this chart is the same as the previous section. The resulting chart provides an easy-to-understand picture of the COVID-19 situation in each province of the country. This chart also makes it easy to compare the number of cases in different regions.

### Line Chart

The line chart shows the cumulative cases and deaths from COVID-19 in Thailand over time. The X-axis represents the time interval, while the Y-axis shows the number of cases and total fatalities. The data used in this chart is also sourced from the previous section. The results provide a clear and easy-to-understand picture of the evolution of the COVID-19 situation in the country.

### Tooltip

All charts in this project include a tooltip that provides detailed information on each province's data. Hovering over the data on the chart will reveal the tooltip.
